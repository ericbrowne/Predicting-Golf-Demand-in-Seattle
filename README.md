# Predicting-Golf-Demand-in-Seattle
During this project, I predicted the elastic demand for Golf in the Greater Seattle area, in the form of total rounds of golf played.  
After some data preprocessing of feature selection, normalization, and correction for Heteroskedasticity, my Multiple Linear Regression model is very accurate with an adjusted R-squared of around 0.86.
